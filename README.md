# Archaeobotanical Data from the Indus Civilization
### A Repository of Jennifer Bates' Published Archaeobotanical Dataset

This repository contains a collection of archaeobotanical samples, compiled by Seoul National University's Jennifer Bates, from across the Indus Valley and dating to the Indus Civilization, c.3200-1500 BCE. 

This data has been reorganized into two tables, one called `samples.csv` that lists the 110 samples from 63 Indus sites, and another called `taxa.csv` that contains all taxa found in the samples, with their scientific names, common names, domestication status, and a unique ID. There is also a `relation_table`, listing all unique occurrences of a taxa in any sample (by sample_id and taxon_id). This table can be used to relate the two tables. 

The tables have been added to a DuckDB database called `archbot.db`, where they can be queried in SQL. This repository also has a SQL folder, which contains four SQL queries: 
- dom_count_all.sql : Find the sum of domesticated species at all sites
- sample_dom_count.sql : Find the number of domesticated species from each respective sample
- sample_taxa.sql : When used in a function in R, list the species found in a given sample
- most_common_taxa_all : Find the ten most common species across all samples

Bates' original publication is also stored in this repository for context and reference.
